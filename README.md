# smartHome
Decentralized smart home network for home automation based on Rust and UDP Multicast

Although this is written in rust with a focus on RaspberryPi's and HummingBoard's running ArchLinux on them
it should run on any device rust can compile to.

### Future plans
* Distribution of bigger load (e.g. webserver) to most powerful node
* Inputs
    * KNX<sub><sup>1</sup></sub>
    * Temperature/Pressure/Humidity sensor
    * Button panels
    * Touchpanel
    * Virtual inputs (apps, website)
* Outputs
    * KNX<sub><sup>1</sup></sub>
    * GPIO relay control
* WebApp for remote access from outside
* Automatic WiFi roaming
    * Connections between nodes via WiFi
    * Network wide change of security/wifi properties with one click
* iOS native app <sub><sup>(Android as soon as AnyMesh supports it)</sup></sub>
    * Indoor localization
    * Fast access to controls in current room
* REST API
* Indoor localization via BLE
    * Music that follows you through the rooms
    * Automated light transitions between rooms
* Video streaming to TVs all over the network <sub><sup>(Steam In-home-streaming anyone?)</sup></sub>
* Voice recognition
* Printer sharing

<sub><sup>1</sup> Running EIBd service required.</sub>

### Compiling on ARMv6/7
* Follow this [guide](https://github.com/warricksothr/RustBuild) to get rustc/cargo running on your raspi
* Execute `cargo build --release --bin multicast` and copy the binary to the binary directory of your trust
* In case you want to use the GPIO plugin you have to install [wiringPi](http://wiringpi.com/download-and-install/)
